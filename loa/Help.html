<h2>Rules</h2>
Black moves first.
Each turn, the player to move moves one of his pieces, in a straight line, exactly as many squares as there are pieces of either color anywhere along the line of movement. (These are the Lines of Action).
You may jump over your own pieces.
You may not jump over your opponents pieces, but you can capture them by landing on them.
A player wins by having all thier pieces lined up continuiously.
